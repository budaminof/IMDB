### IMDB project with AngularJS
##### Explanation is needed:
So, this is our first version.
we used a partial, 2 directives and a service.
we were happy.
But then, someone said it is not the Angular way.
so that's when we fogot to branch, and forgot to commit.
You can see the result on Master branch.
It is a work in progress.
